# (Android.mk)Developed by fredvj test by JimRuss. Generates 370kb iso-9660    # Size should be 8MB to 10MB for operating system of this size.
# (Should call on modules and path to generate iso needed)(iso needs to       # be placed in (OUT_TARGET_DIR) after iso generation so it can be deleted for # new builds. Could generate autorun.iso to pertain to individual builds!
# Might need autorun.inf,what modules need to be included,and how to set path?
# Path would need a file to execute commands and autorun.inf
# Would command file need to be changed as builds and modules change or can it # be versatile
